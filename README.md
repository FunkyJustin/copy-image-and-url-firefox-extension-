# copy-image-and-url-firefox-extension-

A simple extension that copies the URL of the page you are currently in when you click "Copy Image" on the firefox context menu (The menu that pops up when you right click on something, in this case, on images)

The background behind this one is from my curation of pictures that I put in my OneNote Notebooks, I keep forgetting to copy the URL I got the image from and waste several minutes trying to reverse image search it back to look for the original source, with this add-on (or extension) I can simplify the task of doing this.

This is the normal process:
1. I see image on Firefox
2. I right click on image
3. I press copy image
4. I switch to Onenote window
5. I paste the image on Onenote ("Paste as image" doesn't put sources for some reason)
6. I go back to to Firefox on the same page
7. I copy the URL of the by going to the address bar of the page, highlight the URL and CTRL + C 
8. I then paste that URL under the image

With this extension:
1. I see image on Firefox
2. I right click on image
3. I press copy image
4. I switch to OneNote window
5. I paste the image
6. I press Win + V
7. I click on the copied URL on the clipboard history and it pastes it under the Image
